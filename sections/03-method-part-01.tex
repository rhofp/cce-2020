\section{Method}
\label{sec:metodo}

In order to build the knowledge graph of the semantic relationships between the objects found in a certain indoor space of human occupation, such as a room, a deductive database \cite{stichbury}, named Grakn, was used.

Grakn is an Open Source engine for creating knowledge graphs that allow the user to organize and model complex data networks using the Entity-Relationship scheme in its maximum expressiveness. The architecture of Grakn is basically made up of two parts, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:arch}: \textit{Grakn} (the storage) and \textit{Graql} (the language).

\end{figure}

In general, \textit{Grakn} can be seen as a distributed, hyper-relational database that uses intuitive ontology, this is, it uses the definition of types, properties, and relationships between existing entities in a given context, to model complex data, which serves as a knowledge base for cognitive systems \cite{dbengines}. 

Thus, base on the architecture of Grakn, at the bottom we can see the system layer, which is made of Apache technologies: i) \textit{HBase}\footnote{Cassandra database servers the same purposes. It is  a non-relational database that is distinguished by its speed, scale, and simplicity in design.} is a distributed, scalable, big data store database; ii) \textit{Spark} for a distributed processing system used for big data workloads; and iii) \textit{Hadoop} allows us to handle distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. These technologies are \textit{Tinkerpop} tools to create the structure of the knowledge graph.

On the other side, \textit{Graql} represents the Grakn interface, where through queries knowledge can be retrieved explicitly or implicitly. In addition, Grakn was designed to be integrated with other technologies that allow it to function in a distributed manner, for example, as a complement in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) systems \cite{grakn-youtube}. Thus, Grakn from its creation in 2016 to date is used by several companies, such as Google and Cisco; and by institutions like MIT, OpenCTI, and Cares Genetics. Table \ref{fig:grakn-car} summarizes the most important features reported by the db-engines site. A more detailed explanation can be found on the official Grakn site (https://grakn.ai).

\subsection{Grakn installation}

To install Grakn, Java 8 SDK is previously required, if not you can download Oracle or OpenJDK implementation. To install Grakn in Linux we can use three package managers: \texttt{dnf}, \texttt{yum} (for systems that uses RPM\footnote{RPM is a recursive acronym which means RPM Package Manager}) and \texttt{apt}. Besides, Grakn is also available for X OS operative system,  through \texttt{brew} package manager. For this paper, the testing implementations were made using CentOS 8.2 and Manjaro Linux 20.0.

Another important point is that Grakn works similarly to database management systems, that is, services must be started, users must be created, workspaces must be created, among others. In Grakn the abstract models that encapsulate the entities of a particular problem are known as \textit{Keyspace}, where the \textit{schemes} that will represent the data of the case study are defined.

An \textit{scheme} is an inherent part of the knowledge graph that describes what data is like and how it can be structured. It can be represented by an Entity-Relationship diagram. On the other side, Grakn has various types that made up the core system and provide the vocabulary necessary to describe any case study. Among the main types that Grakn handles, the following stand out:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Entities}. They provide the means to classify the objects of a given domain.
    \item \textit{Relationships}. They connect the elements, known in Grakn as \textit{things} from a particular domain. They can be objects, relationships y attributes.
    \item \textit{Attributes}. They describe the entities.
\end{itemize}

In Graql we can perform data manipulation and data definition operations.
Likewise, it is important to mention that the query language \textit{Graql} has the following characteristics, which were useful for this work.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Declarative}. In order to make a query with Graql, it may describe what you want to recover, instead of saying how it should be obtained.
    \item \textit{Intuitive}. Graql was designed to provide a high-level query language interface with clear, readable syntax.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Semantic relationships schema}

The semantic characterization created in this work is based on the structure: \texttt{object1--predicate--object2} proposed in \cite{Cewu}, who points out that visual relationships capture a wide variety of interactions between pairs of objects in images. Therefore, it is recommended to extract the possible relationships that may exist, in order to reduce them and work more efficiently. Besides, the relations between each pair of objects are required to have a predicate individually, and based on this a classification is made to generate a relation. The most common types of predicates are classified by an action, space, a preposition, a comparison, or a verb as seen in Figure \ref{fig:predaCar}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=8.8cm]{figures/predica.png}
    \caption{Predicates categorized. Source \cite{Cewu}.}
    \label{fig:predaCar}
\end{figure}

Based on the above, in this work, the characterization of objects by spatial predicates was performed, since the objects found in a certain space of human occupation, such as a room, are static. Whereas, in this case, predicates based on verbs (actions) were not useful. In the Figures from \ref{fig:abelow} to \ref{fig:topUnder} the relationships used to make the knowledge graph are shown.

    \caption{Relation onTop-under.}
    \label{fig:topUnder}
\end{figure}

The elements recognize as objects have two attributes which are the identifier (ID) and the name as shown in Figure \ref{fig:object}. However, as more predicates are incorporated, it is possible to add more attributes to the object in order to better describe the relationship.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=3.5cm]{figures/object.jpg}
    \caption{Object attributes.}
    \label{fig:object}
\end{figure}

Before implementing the knowledge graph with Grakn, we did a draft of it, in order to visually identify the relationships that must be created through the tool. This conceptual design is seen in Figure \ref{fig:grafo}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=8.8cm]{figures/grafo.jpg}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Development}

The implementation of the knowledge graph in Grakn was based on the previously defined relationships scheme, shown in the previous section. Thus, with the help of the Graql language, relations of type \texttt{above-below} were defined first and then the object, as can be seen in Listing \ref{lst:script1} and \ref{lst:script2}, respectively.

\lstinputlisting[language=Python, firstline=1, lastline=8,
caption=Relationship definition using Graql., label={lst:script1}]{code/schema.gql}

\lstinputlisting[language=Python, firstline=22, lastline=35,
caption=Object definition using Graql., label={lst:script2}]{code/schema.gql}

Later, we insert the object and its relationships data with the code seen in Listing \ref{lst:script3}, for inserting the objects and Listing \ref{lst:script4} to insert the relationships.
%another script was created to insert the objects, as well as to insert the relationships that exist between them. It should be noted that the identifier is assigned automatically, so it is not necessary to declare it when inserting it. The insertion of the objects is done with the reserved word \textit{insert} and the relations with the combination of words \textit{insert} and \textit{match}, as seen in Listing \ref{lst:script3} and \ref{lst:script4}. A total of seventeen objects were inserted.

\lstinputlisting[language=Python, firstline=1, lastline=2,
caption=Object insertion., label={lst:script3}]{code/data.gql}

\lstinputlisting[language=Python, firstline=62, lastline=65,
caption=Object relationship., label={lst:script4}]{code/data.gql}

On the other side, to execute the code it was necessary to create a dedicated \textit{keyspace}, which was named \texttt{vision\_relationships}, where the schemes and relationships were made. Finally, to check that the objects have been inserted correctly, a query was made via console, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:correct}. Thus, the created objects were also counted.
