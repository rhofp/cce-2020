In this paper, we propose a knowledge graph to describe the indoor space objects 
semantic relationships. In this article we use a bedroom. 
We base our work on the representation model Object1--Predicate--Object2. In 
the predicate, we consider spatial relationships such as above, below, under, 
on top, next to, in, has, in front, and behind. To fulfill our purpose, we 
used the Grakn NoSQL database, which allows defining a knowledge graph schema of
type entity-relation. The obtained knowledge graph needs a previously identified 
object in order to start looking for the correct relationships. That object is 
considered as input to the algorithm. The information on the semantic 
relationship has proved effectiveness in characterizing objects using 
Grakn, through which it was possible to characterize objects and their 
relationships based on the principles of knowledge representation.
